# Requirements

- access to JIRA board
- stories/CRQs/improvements/etc. need to be assigned to the one who will present it
- task descriptions need to be checked (they will be used for the slides, so check if they were appropriate if customers came too)
- please save the presentation on the day of the sprint change, this will result in better page speed.
- if you can't see any boards on the `/dashboard` page, you first need to favourite the boards in `/boards`
- the grading key for the completion rate looks as follows:
  - completion rate < 75% => red
  - completion rate > 75% and < 100%  => orange
  - completion rate > 100% => blue
